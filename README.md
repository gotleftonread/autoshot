# autoshot
are you tired of having to open up the snipping tool? do you just want a screenshot of your whole screen?
well look no further, all you have to do is run the "autoshot" file and bam, you have as screenshot of your screen automatically sent to your folders

HOW TO RUN

1. download zip file
2. extract zip file
3. run autoshot.exe

NOTE: WHEN YOU RUN AUTOSHOT.EXE IT WILL CREATE A FOLDER IN YOUR PICTURES NAMED "autoshot" THIS IS WHERE YOUR SCREENSHOT WILL BE STORED (you can move the pictures to a different folder after screenshot)

NOTE 2: IF OYU HAVE MORE THAN ONE MONITOR THE FILE WILL TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF ONLY YOUR MAIN MONITOR
